/*25.	Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green.
If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
(The version that fails will have no output.)*/
