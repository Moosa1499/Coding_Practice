Cars: Write a function that stores information about
a car in a Object. 
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a 
model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of 
keyword arguments. Call the function with the required 
information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color 
or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to 
make sure all the information was stored correctly.
